# Audio Classification with PyTorch

This project is an audio classification pipeline implemented using Python and PyTorch. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach for downloading, processing, and training a model on an audio dataset.

## Features
- Data downloading using `gdown`.
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- PyTorch-based model training and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following Python packages:
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `tqdm`
  - `gdown`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook audio_classification.ipynb
   ```

## Data
The notebook downloads the dataset using `gdown`. Ensure you have internet access and permissions to download the dataset.
